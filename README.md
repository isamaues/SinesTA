# tflite_model_adioset_yamnet_modified
Slightly modified version of the yamnet and tensorflow implementations used on a audio recognition research project with academic purpose. The project is still on development and tests stages so none of it has been published or presented yet.

Original version's repository:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/yamnet

Files removed:
- README.md
- inference.py
- yamnet_vizualization.ipynb
- yamnet_test.py

All those files can still be found on the original repository as mentioned above.

Files added:
- inference3.py
- features_tflite.py
